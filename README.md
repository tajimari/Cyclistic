For my capstone project from the Google Data Analytics Course, I have decided to take on the Cyclistic case study. 
I will be taking on the role of a data analyst for Cyclistic, a bike-share company based in Chicago. 
I have followed the six steps in the process detailed in the course, which are Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act.

Full report of my Cyclistic Case Study can be found on medium [here](https://medium.com/@riku.tajima/cyclistic-case-study-3c63ed25e8e0).

All visualizations used in report can be found on [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/views/CyclisticCaseStudy_16438335844010/GeoData_Casual?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
